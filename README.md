# Goal

Training a CNN based custom neural network model with Pytorch and quantize its layers to 1, 2, 4, 8-bit with quantization-aware-training (QAT). Output of the process ONNX file is used as input file of FINN compiler.


# Brevitas

Brevitas is a PyTorch library for neural network quantization, with support for both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT).
